# Project Title: 
  FAQ CHAT BOT

# Problem Statement/Opportunity:
PROBLEM STATEMENT- Building a web chat bot to answer the questions of a user on a website.
PROBLEM OPPORTUNITY-By creating a web chat bot we can make user experience more better in terms of interaction through a bot rather than the user reading from a website. We can create our own Question and answer list which we think user might ask.

# Project Description:
  My aim is to create a chat bot which can have interaction with the user in case a user has any doubts or to answers frequently asked questions.This will save the user time, 
  as every time a user visits a website he/she has to go through all the FAQs to find solution for his/her doubt.So by creating a bot we can mention all the FAQs in the QnA     Maker related to our website/service so it is easy to chat with the bot and get solution to queries.Also it will make the website interactive and attractive for users.For     my project I have used the FAQs from FRT portal itself I have created a QnA service in Azure and build my own Knowledge Base in QnA Maker.Then I created a Web App Bot and     added the embed code to a html page where interaction can be done with the bot.We can add this bot to any domain page which has FAQs section.
